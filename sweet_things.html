			<p>Once upon a time. There was a red tulip. It was so red and bright that everyone wanted it for themselves. One day, the tulip noticed a pure white daisy growing beside it. As the pure white daisy grew day by day. It slowly turned its head towards the tulip, "Dude, do you know we can talk?" The tulip shook its head solemnly from side to side. It was dumb. The daisy let out a hearty giggle. The daisy started chatting to the tulip everyday even though there wasn't a response. The daisy was full of curiosity and questions. It drove the tulip crazy. The tulip wanted to ask the daisy questions but it can't. The tulip is there, quietly listening to everything the daisy has to say. Gradually, the daisy learned how to interpret the tulip's gaze. Deep down, the tulip's unwanted jealously grew each day. It badly wants to talk and have a proper conversation but it loathes that it is unable to. As time went by, the tulip realized that it won't last much longer. The daisy also slowly realized that fact and tried to hide its sadness by still being its bubbly self around the tulip....</p>

Actually wanted you to fill them up because I wanted to fulfill the doable ones slowly but surely. ]</p>
